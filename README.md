## About

What is this project about. Ok to enrich here or the section above it with an image. 

This project was setup using the SDG JavaScript starter repo template and yarn workspace. The setup contains

Jest: For runnung tests. We strongly recommend that JavaScript projects use Jest

Eslint & Prettier: For formatting code to match ESlint AirBnB coding standard. You might need to install the ESlint and Prettier plugins for your code editor to make the most of these utilities

Yarn workspace: For creating the monorepo projects

## Why

This project seeks to proffer solution to the SDG Goal 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.
## Problem Statement 3

Imagine through direct investment from your communities government or international cooperation. Build a platform that would help manage, track and ensure the effective implementation of an SME financing project for your community

## This solution presents a platform through which Small & Medium Scale businesses can have access government or individual contributed funds. Also, funds disbursement and implementation can be monitored and accounted for by the various users categories

## Usage
 How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup

## Setup

Install `yarn` if you don't have it already installed.

After clonning the repo to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` on the root to get started by installing dependencies. Also Run `yarn install` inside the frontend and backend directory

`src/index.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `__tests__' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter template used to setup the development environment uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler than WebPack and the others

## Hints

-Run `yarn install` in the root directory to get started. This will install all the dependencies on both
the frontend and backend directory.
-Create .env file in the frontend directory, paste "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" in the file, without the quotation mark.
-Run tests: `yarn test`
-Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`.
-Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
-Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.
